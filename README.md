# Hi, I'm Atefeh 👋

I'm a junior QA with a **process-aware mindset**.
I focus on **manual testing**, **risk-based testing**, and translating
business/user flows into clear test scenarios and actionable bug reports.

## What I do
- Derive test scenarios from user flows (not just UI clicks)
- Identify **business risks** (user drop-off, conversion issues)
- Identify **security risks** (abuse, enumeration, brute-force)
- Write clear, reproducible bug reports with severity & priority

## Featured case studies
- [Registration flow with email verification](https://github.com/atefeat/qa-registration-bpmn-case-study)
- [Login flow with failed attempts & time-based lockout](https://github.com/atefeat/qa-login-lockout-case-study)
